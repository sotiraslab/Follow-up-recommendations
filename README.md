1. First step. Download [model directory](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13-Z3LSTABo1o18RnE0jbIkrzIexn_K7W?usp=drive_link) and put it under './textcnn_hybrid/'. The directory for the model's checkpoint should appear as follows: './textcnn_hybrid/Radreport_Impression_f1/checkpoints/textcnn_impression/...'

2. Second step. Set up the environments. `conda env create -f textcnn.yml`.
